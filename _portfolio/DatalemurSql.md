p.s. If you've read the Ace the Data Science Interview and liked it, consider writing us a review?

Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
post_id	integer
post_content	text
post_date	timestamp
posts Example Input:
user_id	post_id	post_content	post_date

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!


Solution:
---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------


SELECT
user_id,
MAX(post_date::DATE) - MIN(post_date::DATE) AS days_between
FROM
posts
where  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM post_date) =2021
GROUP BY
user_id,
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM post_date)
HAVING
COUNT(post_id) > 1
ORDER BY
user_id;



Laptop vs. Mobile Viewership [New York Times SQL Interview Question]

This is the same question as problem #3 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. Output the total viewership for laptops as laptop_reviews and the total viewership for mobile devices as mobile_views.

Effective 15 April 2023, the solution has been updated with a more concise and easy-to-understand approach.

viewership Table
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
device_type	string ('laptop', 'tablet', 'phone')
view_time	timestamp
viewership Example Input
user_id	device_type	view_time
123	tablet	01/02/2022 00:00:00
125	laptop	01/07/2022 00:00:00
128	laptop	02/09/2022 00:00:00
129	phone	02/09/2022 00:00:00
145	tablet	02/24/2022 00:00:00
Example Output
laptop_views	mobile_views
2	3
Explanation
Based on the example input, there are a total of 2 laptop views and 3 mobile views.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Solution:
---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------
SELECT
SUM(CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_count,
SUM(CASE WHEN device_type IN ('phone', 'tablet') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_count
FROM viewership;
